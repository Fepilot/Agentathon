| **Capabilities** | Answer predefined questions | Execute complex tasks |
| **Learning** | Static | Continuously improving |
| **Integration** | Limited | Deep system integration |
| **Autonomy** | User-driven | Can act independently |

```

### Key Components

1. **Trigger**: How the agent is invoked (conversation, event, schedule)
2. **Instructions**: The system prompt that defines behavior
3. **Knowledge**: Data sources the agent can access
4. **Actions**: Tasks the agent can perform
